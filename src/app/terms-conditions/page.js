                      attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
                      expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty
                      (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal

                      If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through
                      informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
                      expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively
                      resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

                      COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be
                      commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
                      Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and,
                      where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for

                      which are available at the American Arbitration
                      Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees and your
                      share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the
                      AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the
                      AAA Consumer Rules.

                    <p>
                      The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
                      submission of documents, by phone, or online. The
                      arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not
                      provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either
                      Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
                      award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
                      Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA
                      rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place
                      in Arizona. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
                      Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
                      proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify,
                      vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
                      arbitrator.

                      If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
                      arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted
                      in the state and federal courts located in __________, and
                      the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of
                      lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens
                      with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and

                    <p>
                      The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not
